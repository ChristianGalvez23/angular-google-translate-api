# Angular Translator App

I developed this frontend web app using Google API. Once you run this app you'll have to introduce your API Key provided by Google Dev.

The only constraint is that app was developed to translate from english to spanish. I will implement other languages later.

**Requirements**: You have to get your API Key on Google.
